## TASK DESCRIPTION

Optimizing Production Planning Using Linear Programming-This internship project focuses on the application of optimization techniques in data science to solve a real-world business problem using linear 
programming. The task involves formulating and solving an optimization model using Python and the PuLP library. The objective is to assist a company in determining the optimal production quantities of 
two products, Product A and Product B, to maximize profit while satisfying specific resource constraints.

The business scenario assumes that each product requires a fixed amount of labor and material to produce, and each yields a defined profit. Product A consumes 2 hours of labor and 1 kilogram of material
per unit and returns a profit of $40. Product B consumes 3 hours of labor and 2 kilograms of material per unit and returns a profit of $50. The company has access to 400 labor hours and 300 kilograms of
materials. The task is to find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce in order to maximize total profit, while not exceeding the available labor and material resources.

The optimization model is developed using the PuLP library, a powerful linear programming toolkit in Python. The decision variables are defined as the number of units of Product A and Product B to be 
produced, which are constrained to be non-negative continuous values. The objective function is formulated to maximize the total profit, calculated as 40*A + 50*B, where A and B represent the number 
of units of Product A and Product B respectively.

Two constraints are applied to the model: the total labor hours used (2*A + 3*B) must not exceed 400, and the total material used (1*A + 2*B) must not exceed 300. The linear programming problem is solved
using the built-in solver in PuLP. The result provides the optimal values of A and B that yield the highest possible profit while satisfying the constraints.

To enhance understanding and visualization of the solution, the feasible region defined by the constraints is plotted using matplotlib. The constraint lines are graphed and the area of feasible solutions 
is shaded. The optimal solution point is highlighted on the graph, providing a visual confirmation of the maximum profit point within the feasible region.

The final output includes the optimal quantities of Product A and Product B to be produced, as well as the maximum achievable profit. Additionally, the insights section summarizes the key findings, such
as the exact number of units to produce and confirms that all constraints have been met.

This project demonstrates how linear programming and Python can be effectively used to solve decision-making problems in business. It highlights the relevance of optimization in resource allocation and 
operational efficiency. The approach and solution are structured clearly to fulfill the internship requirement of demonstrating problem setup, coding implementation, solution, and analytical insights
using Python-based optimization techniques.
